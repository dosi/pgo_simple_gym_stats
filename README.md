# pgo_simple_gym_stats
Simplified gym stats for all pokemon &amp; quick move combinations. 
As mentioned in table header, the simplified stats are:

"Attack points" : Quick Move power per second * Pokemon's Base Attack. Takes into account *1.25 from matching types

"Defense points" : Simply Base Stamina * Base Defense

I made this for simple quick reference on what is good and what is not.

The multiplicative nature of the points might not best represent the full capabilities of the pokemon + move combinations.
